# F1Dashboards

**F1Dashboards** is a free, open, and ad-free web project dedicated to interactive Formula 1 data visualization.  
It aims to make F1 statistics and historical data accessible to everyone through modern, responsive dashboards built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Plotly.js.

## üö¶ Project Overview

F1Dashboards provides interactive dashboards to explore F1 constructors, drivers, and race results with an elegant, racing-inspired design.  
All dashboards are fully client-side and require no backend, making them fast, lightweight, and easy to host.
